# Hiring Process Analysis

**Project Description:**

In this project we are going to do the complete end-to-end analysis of the
operation analytics of a company and also find out the Investigating metric spike. With the help of
operation analytics we find the insights about the job data and review of jobs. In investigating metric
spike we have found the performance of the company by understanding the user metrics, I have
used Advanced SQL queries to answer the case study. Let us discuss in detail.



## Case Study Description

**Approach:**

First I have downloaded the given data sets for the two case studies and understood the
data, as the data sets were in the CSV format I had to load them into the database by writing the SQL
queries, but the data were very big so I have used the import wizard to load the data into MySQL
Workbench. As I have understood the data I started working with the queries using Advance SQL, it
was bit complex at the beginning but later I found the importance of earning the data.
## Tech Stack
I have used
1. MySQL server 8.0
2. MySQL Workbench 8.0.18
3. MySQL shell 8.0

## Results

 This Project was the great Practise for the real life Case studies and the Business
Intelligence point of view. It was the wonderful experience. Initially I faced issues in uploading the
huge data sets to the database but gradually learnt and applied all the concepts newly learnt in the
Advanced SQL topics.
